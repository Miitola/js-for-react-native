This project contains javascript for arrayManipulation and userProfile creation.

Task 1: Process an Array of Numbers
The `processArray` function takes an array of numbers as input and returns a new array where each even number is squared and each odd number is tripled.


Task 2: Format Array Strings Based on Numbers
The `formatArrayStrings` function takes two arrays as input: an array of strings and an array of numbers processed by processArray. It modifies each string based on its corresponding number: capitalizing the entire string if the number is even, and converting the string to lowercase if the number is odd.

Task 3: Create User Profiles
The `createUserProfiles` function takes an array of original names and an array of modified names as input. It returns an array of objects, each containing the original name, modified name, and an auto-incremented id starting from 1.
